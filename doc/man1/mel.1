.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI mel
.RI [[[ wavefile " ...]"
.IR infile ]
.IR outfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Interpret ASCII input in
.IR infile
as audio and save it to
.IR outfile
in the WAVE format, optionally using samples provided in
.IR wavefile s.
The syntax for
.IR infile
is given below.
Filenames default to
.BR /dev/stdin
or
.BR /dev/stdout .
The dash
.RB ( - )
is a shorthand for the default value.
.SH SYNTAX
.IR infile
shall contain words
.IR w
(sequences of lowercase letters
.BR a " to " z " and hashes " # ),
numbers
.IR n
(sequences of digits
.BR 0 " to " 9 ,
decimal points
.BR . ,
and a dividing colon
.BR : ),
and commands (other single ASCII characters).
Commands are followed by words and/or numbers as arguments, as listed below.
The input is processed linearly, whereby unexpected characters, including whitespace, act as separators and are otherwise ignored.

.BI report
Print note counts (since last report) to standard output.

are counted.
This is useful to, e.g., to determine the keynote of a piece of music.
.TP
.BI detune n
Randomly detune frequency, including concert pitch
.BR A4 ,
by up to
.IR n
halftones.
In combination with text and time marks, this is useful to generate non-white noise.
.RE
.TP
.BI L n " " n' " " m " " m'
Apply flanger to sound between
.IR n th
and
.IR n' th
time mark, if marks have been set.

per sample length, using the current wave sample, and superimposed with itself.
