.PP
Convert
.IR infile
in the Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF, developed by Apple) into
.IR outfile
in the Waveform Audio File Format (RIFF/WAVE, developed by IBM and Microsoft).
Both store uncompressed audio data in a chunk-based container format.
The main difference is that AIFF and WAVE employ the big-endian and little-endian byte order, respectively.
Filenames default to
.BR /dev/stdin
or
.BR /dev/stdout .
The dash
.RB ( - )
is a shorthand for the default value.
