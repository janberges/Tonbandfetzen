.TH GUITAR 1 2020 "Jan Berges" "Tonbandfetzen Manual"
.SH NAME
guitar \- read guitar tablature
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI guitar
.IR infile
.IR outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Preprocess input for the program
.BR mel
to allow for guitar tablatures.
.SH SYNTAX
The syntax of
.IR infile
is as described in
.BR mel (1),
with the following exceptions:
If a line of contains more than one vertical bar
.RB ( | ),
it is interpreted as guitar tablature.
Then, everything between two
.BR | s
represents one bar/measure.
Here, the commands
.BR | \fIn\fR,
.BR - \fIn\fR,
and
.BI ~ n
cannot be applied as usual and the plus
.RB ( + )
of the
.BI + n
command can be omitted.
The bar duration, defined beforehand via the
.BI | n
command, is evenly distributed among the enclosed characters.
The hyphen-minus
.RB ( - )
represents a string at rest (a pause), all other characters, in particular the tilde
.RB ( ~ ),
represent a vibrating string (sound is played), in addition to their actual meanings.
Tablature lines that are not separated by an empty line start at the same position in time.
This is realized via the
.BR M0
mark, which shall not be used manually.
