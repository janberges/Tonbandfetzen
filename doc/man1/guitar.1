.TH GUITAR 1 2020 "Jan Berges" "Tonbandfetzen Manual"
.SH NAME
guitar \- read guitar tablature
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI guitar
.RI [ infile
.RI [ outfile ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Preprocess input for the program
.BR mel
to allow for guitar tablatures.
.IR infile
and
.IR outfile
default to
.BR /dev/stdin
and
.BR /dev/stdout ,
respectively.
The dash
.RB ( - )
is a shorthand for the default value.
.SH SYNTAX
The syntax of
.IR infile
is as described in
.BR mel (1),
with the following exception:
Text between two
.BR | s
that contains at least one hyphen-minus
.RB ( - )
or tilde
.RB ( \(ti ),
represents one bar/measure.
Here, the commands
.BI | n \c
,
.BI \- n \c
, and
.BI \(ti w \c
.RI [ n ]
cannot be applied as usual and the
.BR U
of the
.BI U n
command can be omitted.
The bar duration, defined beforehand via the
.BI | n
command, is evenly distributed among the enclosed characters.
The hyphen-minus
.RB ( - )
represents a string at rest (a pause), all other characters, in particular the tilde
.RB ( \(ti ),
represent a vibrating string (sound is played), in addition to their actual meanings.
Lines with tablature that are not separated by an empty line start at the same point in time.
This is realized via the
.BR M0
mark, which shall not be used manually.
